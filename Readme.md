# Data exploration and vizualization on COVID-19 with SQL , R, and Tableau

I worked on a very interesting dataset that you can find in this [link](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer). The goal was to practice my sql queries and tableau vizualisation. First I documented myself about the dataset, explored it both manually and using R, then started quering, used also R to practice creating charts and of course vizulation on Tableau which you can find [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid19_viz/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
